						Treepz is a tech-enabled shared mobility platform that offers
						commuters predictability, accessibility, and safety in their daily

						broken public transport and expensive ride hailing services in
						Africa. Our goal is o revolutionize the African transportation
						sector using technology-driven solutions and to create a

						Treepz for staff of organisations

						designers and engineering team to ship a successful mobile app.

							new features based on user feedback
						</li>
					</ul>
