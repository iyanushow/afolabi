					<h2>About Me:</h2>
					<p>
						Hey! I'm a product manager based in Toronto with a passion for
						building innovative software products. With four years of experience
						in the industry, I have had the privilege of working on some
						exciting projects, including Treepz, in the area of shared mobility.
					</p>
					<p>
						My passion for technology and entrepreneurship has driven my
						interest in product management. As a product manager, I love the
						challenge of bringing a product to market by working closely with
						cross-functional teams and using data to inform product decisions.
						My goal is to create products that not only meet the needs of users
						but also drive business growth.
					</p>
					<p
						>I thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy taking on new
						challenges. I am an analytical thinker and enjoy using data to
						inform product decisions. I also enjoy working with teams to bring
						ideas to life, and I am comfortable with Agile methodologies.
					</p>
					<p
						>I am excited to continue my journey in product management, and I am
						always looking for new and exciting opportunities to make a
						difference. If you're looking for a passionate and results-driven
						product manager, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
