                          <h3>My Role:</h3>
                          <p>
                              As Product Manager for Bell Email, I worked with our multidisciplinary team to take the 
                              Emails new front end from conception to launch.
                               I conducted research, user interviews, managed user onboarding, 
                               oversaw operations training / support and worked closely with the executive team, product designers and lead engineers.
                          </p>


                          <h3>The Product:</h3>
                          <p>
                              In terms of core product features, Bell Email is extremely similar to other popular email platforms.
                               For example, emailing, calendar, contacts and tasks. However, its 10 year old UI was unfriendly
                                to new users and was incompatible with planned new backend. As PM, I was tasked with modernizing
                                 the user interface while migrating the back-end user data.
                          </p>


                          <h3>What I Did:</h3>
