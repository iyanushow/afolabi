                    <h3>The Product:</h3>
                    <p>
                      Bell has roughly 10K technicians who are responsible for maintaining its network. In their day to day, technicians often find safety hazards such as downed polls or live wires. To report these hazards, tech’s would have to fill out a lengthy excel file form and email it to the right resources. Under this model, critical information was being missed (Ex, address of hazard) and hazards were taking months to resolve. 

                      The hazard reporting tool helps automate and make this process easier for techs. Built as both a web app and on mobile - the tool is essentially a form with inventory management and automated notifications. When a technician submits a hazard through the tool, it sends an automated email and notification to the relevant resources.

                    <h3>The Role:</h3>
                    <p>
                      As Product Manager for the Safety Hazard Reporting Tool, I worked with our stakeholders and engineering team to take the tool from conception to launch. In conducting user interviews with technicians, I identified the need for an automated tool to help technicians in the field report hazards.. In building the tool, I managed the product design, user interviews, training operations and working closely with my team of four engineers.
                    </p>


                    <h3>What I Did:</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Conducted multiple in person interviews and ride-alongs to understand the problem with hazard reporting</li>
                      
                      <li>Sent out surveys out to 2000+ technicians and managers to gather input on development of the tool </li>

                      <li>Used SQL to gather data on current hazard reporting – to determine where tool should be tested and rolled out first  </li>
                        
                     <li>Worked with four engineers and one UX resource on developing tool </li>

                     <li>Ran weekly check-ins with key stakeholders to ensure all deliverables were on track</li>

                     <li>Mapped out the project's full scope, especially bringing clarity to non-technical tasks and internal admin needs</li>

                  </ul>           
              </br>
                    <h3>Hazard Submission</h3>
                    <span class="image featured"><img src="Portfolio\Assets\hazard_submission.PNG" alt=""></span>
      


                    <h3>Metrics:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Usage of the tool reduced hazard resolution time by 30 days</li>
                          
                        <li>Tool saved $100K annually in technician time managing hazards</li>
                          
                       <li>Time to submit a hazard was reduced from 50 minutes to 8 minutes</li>
                    </ul>
                </br>


                    <h3>Key-Takeaways:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As a product from early in my Product Management career, it taught me the importance of understanding defining the scope of the product.</li>
                          
                        <li>The importance of weighing multiple users groups. In this case - I had to manage building features for those submitting the hazards or those managing the hazards.</li>
                          
                       <li>Importance of developing a MVP and checking in with your users </li>
                    </ul>
