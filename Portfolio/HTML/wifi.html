                          <h3>The Product:</h3>
                          <p>
                            Originally launched in 2018, the Bell Wi-Fi app was a supplementary product offering to users who purchased Wi-Fi pods (think Wi-Fi extenders).
                             Since then, the app has grown into a one-stop destination for managing home Wi-Fi networks. 
                             Used by over 210K active users, the app offers Bell customers the ability to troubleshoot their Wi-Fi and control who accesses it. 
                             As PM for the Wi-Fi app, I have helped build and expand the features below.
                          </p>
                          <P>Core Features:</P>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Pause internet connection for any connected devices</li>
                              
                            <li>See what devices are connected to the network</li>
                              
                           <li>Run speed tests and see signal strength by devices</li>

                           <li>Create user profiles and assign devices </li>

                           <li>Share your network name and password</li>
                        </ul>
                           </br>

                          <h3>The Role:</h3>
                          <p>
                            As Product Manager for the Bell Wi-Fi App, I have helped grow the user base from 40K active users to 210K over an 11-month period. 
                            To achieve this, I worked with the engineering and design teams to develop three localized app versions (Business, Manitoba, and Atlantic) 
                            and develop new value add features.
                          </p>


                          <h3>What I Did:</h3>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Had daily stand-up meetings, clarified scope, implemented changes, prioritized deliverables, got stakeholder acceptance, monitored status for performance and budget. Planned WBS schedule</li>
                            
                            <li>Redesigned and improved login / onboarding process</li>

                            <li>Implemented Jira into engineering and product teams for the Wi-Fi app, leading to a 20% decrease in bug resolution time </li>
                              
                           <li>Built app reporting based on SQL and KIbana data pulls. Reporting was presented to leadership monthly</li>

                           <li>Led an investigation into the app's support environment. Performed a competitive analysis and compared support call volumes to associated article traffic to determine support gaps. Presented findings to senior leadership, leading to video support funding</li>

                           <li>Grew monthly app installs by introducing deep links to other apps in Bells mobile ecosystem</li>
