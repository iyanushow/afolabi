                            <h3>The Product:</h3>
                            <p>
                                Bell Email is one of the companyâ€™s core product offerings, with over a million accounts and 300K active users.
                                 These users represent Bell's most sensitive and oldest customer base, with the average email user being 45% less likely to churn.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In terms of core product features, Bell Email is extremely similar to other popular email platforms, offering features such as emailing, calendar, contacts and tasks. 
                                However, its 10-year-old UI was unfriendly to new users and incompatible with the planned backend. 
                                Due to these factors and other business needs, I was tasked with building a new interface for 300K email users and migrating their back end data.      
                            </p>

                            <h3>My Role:</h3>
                            <p>
                                As Product Manager for Bell Email, I worked with our multidisciplinary team to take the new front end from conception to launch.
                                 I conducted research, user interviews, managed user onboarding, oversaw operations training / support and worked closely with the executive team, product designers and lead engineers.
                            </p>
