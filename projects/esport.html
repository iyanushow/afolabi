					<h3>The Product:</h3>
					<p>
						eSportcave App is a skill-based real money mobile game app with over
						27k active users. These users are generally mobile game lovers or
						enthusiasts who enjoy spending their free time playing mobile games
						but seeking value for the time they spend playing games they love.
					</p>
					<p>
						In terms of core product features, eSportcave is extremely similar
						to other other popular mobile gaming apps, offering features like 1
						vs 1 & Tournament modes for users to compete against each other in
						real-time.
					</p>
					<p>
						While most freemium gaming apps offering similar gaming experience
						to eSportcave, they most times do no have any value to offer their
						users and in most cases let you spend money to play games, Due to
						these factors and other market needs, I was tasked with building a
						real money mobile gaming app that allows users compete against each
						other in real-time and earn real cash prizes.
